        # average (high-load workers) to workers that have less tasks than the average (low-load workers).
        #
        # The overall worst-case time complexity of the balancing algorithm is:
        #
        #     O(n_workers * log(n_workers) + n_tasks * n_workers * n_capabilities)
        #
        # However, if the cluster does not use any capability, time complexity is always:
        #
        #     O(n_workers * log(n_workers) + n_tasks * log(n_workers))
        #
        # If capability constraints are used, this might result in less than optimal balancing. That's because, in some
        # cases, the optimal balancing might require to move tasks between more than two workers. Consider this
        # cluster's state:
        #
        #   Worker 1
        #       Supported capabilities: {Linux, GPU}
        #       Tasks:
        #           Task 1: {Linux}

        #           Task 2: {GPU}
        #           Task 3: {GPU}
        #
        # Here, the algorithm will not be able to rebalance the cluster, while ideally we could move Task 1 to Worker 2
        # and then Task 3 to Worker 1.
        #
        # Balancing algorithms that can find this optimal balancing exist (assignment problem), but these are complex
        # and slow. These might also cause a lot of messages to be propagated through the cluster.
