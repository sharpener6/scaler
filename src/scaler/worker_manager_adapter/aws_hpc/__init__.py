"""
AWS HPC Worker Manager for OpenGRIS Scaler.

Supports multiple AWS HPC backends:
- AWS Batch: Receives tasks from scheduler and submits as Batch jobs

Architecture (TaskManager pattern):
    Scheduler Stream → AWSBatchWorker → AWSHPCTaskManager → AWS Batch Jobs
                                ↓
                        Heartbeats to Scheduler
                                ↓
                    Poll Results → TaskResult to Scheduler

Components:
    - AWSBatchWorker: Process connecting to scheduler stream
    - AWSHPCTaskManager: Handles task queuing, priority, and AWS Batch submission
    - AWSBatchHeartbeatManager: Sends heartbeats to scheduler
    - BatchJobCallback: Tracks task→job mappings
    - batch_job_runner: Script running inside AWS Batch containers
