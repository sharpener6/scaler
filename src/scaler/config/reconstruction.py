"""ConfigClass reconstruction helpers.

There are two distinct data sources that a ConfigClass can be built from, each
handled by a separate function family:

  TOML dict  →  _from_toml(cls, dict)
  argparse   →  _from_args(cls, kwargs)          (no subcommands)
               _from_args_with_subcommands(cls, kwargs, dest)   (with subcommands)

Call-graph summary
------------------
ConfigClass.from_args()
  └─ _from_args_with_subcommands()   # if class has subcommand fields
       ├─ _from_args_with_subcommands()   # recurse for nested subcommands
       └─ _from_args()              # for non-subcommand fields at each level
  └─ _from_args()                  # no subcommands — direct path
       └─ _from_toml()             # for every field that carries section= metadata

_from_toml() only calls itself (for nested ConfigClass fields inside a TOML
section).  It never calls _from_args or _from_args_with_subcommands.

    """Build a ConfigClass instance from a raw TOML section dict.

    This is the TOML-only reconstruction path.  It is called by _from_args
    whenever a field carries ``section=`` metadata, meaning its value comes
    directly from a TOML section rather than from CLI args.

    Key behaviours
    --------------
    * Key normalisation: TOML keys may use hyphens (e.g. ``num-workers``);
      these are converted to underscores before matching against dataclass
      field names.

    * Long-name lookup: when a field has an explicit ``long`` name that
      differs from the field name (e.g. ``long="--logging-level"`` for a
      field named ``level``), only the normalised long name (``logging_level``)
      is accepted as a TOML key — not the field name.  This matches the
      behaviour of ``_toml_section_defaults`` so both entry points accept
      identical TOML keys.

    * Flat vs. nested layout: if a field's type is itself a ConfigClass, two
      TOML layouts are supported:
        - Nested (explicit sub-table): the value at ``data[field.name]`` is a
          dict, which is passed down recursively.
        - Flat: the field name is absent from ``data`` (or its value is not a
          dict), so the *same* ``data`` dict is passed down and the composed
          class pulls its own fields from it.  This lets multiple composed
          classes share a single flat TOML section.

    * Type coercion: the same precedence as ``_from_args`` is used — the
      field's explicit ``type`` metadata (if any) is tried first, then the
      type derived from the field's Python type annotation.  This ensures
      e.g. enum fields with a value-based constructor (``mode = "fixed"``) and
      ConfigType address fields work identically in both entry points.

    Note: this function reads ``data`` without mutating it.  Multiple composed
    ConfigClass fields inside the same parent can therefore all receive the
    same dict safely.

    """Build a ConfigClass instance from a flat argparse-kwargs dict.

    This is the CLI reconstruction path, used for configs without subcommands
    (or for the non-subcommand fields within a subcommand wrapper — see
    _from_args_with_subcommands).

    ``kwargs`` is the mutable dict produced by ``vars(parser.parse_args())``.
    Fields are *popped* from it as they are consumed, so the caller (or a
    sibling recursive call) sees only the fields it owns.  This pop-based
    protocol is what allows a flat argparse namespace to be partitioned across
    a tree of nested ConfigClass objects.

    ``toml_data`` is the full top-level TOML dict (i.e. the entire parsed
    config file).  It is only needed when ``config_cls`` has fields that carry
    ``section=`` metadata, meaning those fields are populated from a named TOML
    section rather than from CLI args (e.g. ``[worker_manager]`` tables that
    can contain a variable number of entries).

    Field dispatch
    --------------
    For each field in config_cls the function picks one of three paths:

    1. ``section=`` metadata — value comes from TOML, not from argparse.
       The raw TOML section is located by name and reconstructed via
       _from_toml().  Handles three TOML shapes:
         a. Discriminated union list: each item has a ``type`` key (or
            whatever ``discriminator`` names) that selects the concrete class.
         b. Single dict (``[section]`` table): reconstructed as a single
            instance, wrapped in a list if the field type is List[...].
         c. List of dicts (``[[section]]`` array-of-tables): each item
            reconstructed independently.

    2. Nested ConfigClass (no ``section=``) — recurse into _from_args(),
       sharing the same mutable ``kwargs`` dict so the nested class consumes
       its own entries.

    3. Plain field — pop the value from ``kwargs`` and use it directly.

    """Build a ConfigClass that has CLI subcommand fields from a flat argparse-kwargs dict.

    This is the entry point for configs that use the ``subcommand`` field
    metadata, which corresponds to argparse subparsers.  For example,
    ``ScalerWorkerManagerConfig`` has mutually exclusive subcommand fields
    (``baremetal_native``, ``symphony``, ``aws_raw_ecs``, ``aws_hpc``), only
    one of which is populated depending on what the user typed on the CLI.

    ``dest`` is the argparse ``dest`` name for the subparser choice at the
    current level (e.g. ``"_sub"`` at the top level, ``"_sub_baremetal_native"``
    one level deeper).  argparse stores the chosen subcommand name under this
    key in the parsed namespace.

    Base case
    ---------
    If ``cls`` has no subcommand fields it is a leaf config; delegate directly
    to _from_args() and return.

    Recursive case
    --------------
    1. Pop ``kwargs[dest]`` to find which subcommand was selected.
    2. Look up the matching field and unwrap Optional[X] if needed to get the
       concrete config class.
    3. Recurse into _from_args_with_subcommands() for the selected subcommand,
       using an extended dest key (``"{dest}_{subcommand}"``).  This handles
       configs with more than one level of nested subparsers.
    4. Build the wrapper instance: all subcommand fields default to None, then
       the selected one is set to the reconstructed sub-config.  Non-subcommand
       fields on the wrapper class are reconstructed via _from_args().

    As in _from_args(), ``kwargs`` is mutated throughout — each level pops the
    fields it owns, leaving the rest for sibling or parent calls.
