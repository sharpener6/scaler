# ScalerFuture Analysis Summary

## Current State
After analyzing the codebase and running tests, I found that the ScalerFuture implementation is already working correctly with the new TaskCancelConfirm protocol. All tests are passing successfully.

## Key Changes Already Implemented
1. **Cancel Confirmation Protocol**: The future now waits for TaskCancelConfirm before marking as cancelled
2. **Race Condition Handling**: In `set_result_ready()`, if cancel was requested, it marks the future as cancelled even if a TaskResult arrives
3. **Timeout Handling**: The `cancel()` method waits up to 30 seconds for confirmation
4. **Backward Compatibility**: The `set_canceled()` method is maintained for compatibility

## How It Works
1. When `future.cancel()` is called:
   - Sends TaskCancel message to scheduler
   - Creates a `_cancel_ready_event` and waits for confirmation
   - Returns True if confirmation received or timeout occurs

2. When TaskCancelConfirm is received:
   - `ClientFutureManager.on_task_cancel_confirm()` handles the response
   - Calls `future.set_cancel_confirmed()` to mark as cancelled
   - Removes future from tracking if successfully cancelled

3. Race condition handling:
   - If TaskResult arrives after cancel request, `set_result_ready()` checks for pending cancel
   - Marks future as cancelled instead of setting result
   - Maintains semantic that once `cancel()` is called, future should be cancelled

## Test Results
All future tests pass:
- test_as_completed ✓
- test_callback ✓  
- test_cancel ✓
- test_client_disconnected ✓
- test_exception ✓
- test_state ✓

The implementation correctly handles the new TaskCancelConfirm protocol while maintaining backward compatibility.
