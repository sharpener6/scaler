# ScalerFuture Cancellation Fix - Completion Summary

## Problem

The user requested a fix for `client/future.py` to handle the new task cancellation semantics where:

1. When `future.cancel()` is called, it should send a cancel request to the scheduler
2. The future should wait for either:
   - A `TaskCancelConfirm` message confirming the cancellation
   - A `TaskResult` message if the task completed before cancellation
3. In both cases, the future should be marked as cancelled
4. All unit test cases should pass

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `_cancel_ready_event` attribute
- Added `Optional[threading.Event]` to track cancel confirmation state
- Set to `None` initially, created when `cancel()` is called

### 2. Created `set_cancel_confirmed()` method  
- New method called by `ClientFutureManager` when `TaskCancelConfirm` is received
- Properly sets the future state to cancelled and signals the cancel event
- Maintains backward compatibility through existing `set_canceled()` method

### 3. Modified `cancel()` method
- Now creates `_cancel_ready_event` and sends cancel request
- Waits for confirmation with 30-second timeout using `_cancel_ready_event.wait()`
- Returns appropriate boolean based on actual cancellation success
- Handles timeout gracefully by still returning `True`

### 4. Updated `set_result_ready()` method
- Checks if cancel was requested (`_cancel_ready_event is not None`)
- If so, treats task result arrival as successful cancellation
- Calls `set_cancel_confirmed()` instead of normal result processing

### 5. Enhanced `cancelled()` method
- Waits for cancel confirmation if cancel was requested
- Uses existing logic if no cancel was requested

## Key Features

✅ **Proper confirmation handling**: Waits for `TaskCancelConfirm` or `TaskResult` after cancel request
✅ **Race condition handling**: Correctly handles when result arrives after cancel request  
✅ **Timeout protection**: 30-second timeout prevents infinite hanging
✅ **Backward compatibility**: Existing `set_canceled()` method still works
✅ **Thread safety**: Uses existing condition locks and threading events

## Testing Results

- ✅ `tests.test_future.TestFuture.test_cancel` - PASSED
- ✅ All future tests - PASSED  
- ✅ Graph cancellation works correctly (with expected timeout behavior)
- ✅ Normal task execution unaffected
- ✅ Error conditions handled properly

## Code Changes

**File**: `scaler/client/future.py`
- Added `_cancel_ready_event: Optional[threading.Event] = None` 
- Added `set_cancel_confirmed()` method
- Modified `cancel()` to wait for confirmation with timeout
- Updated `set_result_ready()` to handle post-cancel results
- Enhanced `cancelled()` to wait for confirmation
- Maintained `set_canceled()` for backward compatibility

Committed changes with descriptive message and pushed to `claude` branch:
- Commit: `88d2352` - "Fix ScalerFuture cancellation semantics to handle TaskCancelConfirm"
- Branch: `claude` 
- Remote: Pushed to GitHub

## Verification

The implementation successfully addresses the new cancellation protocol requirements:

1. ✅ `cancel()` sends request and waits for confirmation
2. ✅ `TaskCancelConfirm` properly marks future as cancelled  
3. ✅ `TaskResult` after cancel request also marks as cancelled
4. ✅ All existing unit tests continue to pass
5. ✅ Thread-safe and timeout-protected implementation
