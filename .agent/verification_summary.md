# TaskCancelConfirm Implementation Verification Summary

## Status: ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY

The current implementation in `scaler/client/future.py` already correctly handles the new TaskCancelConfirm semantics as described by the user.

## Key Findings

### 1. Current Implementation Analysis
The `ScalerFuture` class in `scaler/client/future.py` already implements the required semantics:

- Lines 71-81: When `set_result_ready()` is called after a cancel request (`_cancel_ready_event` is set), the future is marked as cancelled even if a TaskResult was received
- Lines 101-112: `set_cancel_confirmed()` properly handles TaskCancelConfirm messages
- Lines 188-218: The `cancel()` method sends TaskCancel and waits for either TaskCancelConfirm or TaskResult with proper timeout handling

### 2. Protocol Implementation
The protocol infrastructure is complete:
- `TaskCancelConfirm` message types defined in `scaler/protocol/python/message.py`
- Client agent handles TaskCancelConfirm in `scaler/client/agent/client_agent.py:169`
- Future manager processes confirmations in `scaler/client/agent/future_manager.py:70-84`

### 3. Test Results
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ `tests/test_future.py` - All 6 tests pass
- ✅ Custom verification tests confirm correct behavior:
  - Cancel on completed task marks future as cancelled
  - Cancel on running task waits for confirmation
  - Multiple cancel calls handled correctly

### 4. Expected Behavior Confirmed
The implementation correctly handles these scenarios:

1. **Cancel completed task**: When `future.cancel()` is called on a completed task, it marks the future as cancelled and subsequent `result()` calls raise `CancelledError`

2. **Cancel running task**: When `future.cancel()` is called on a running task, it sends TaskCancel and waits for either:
   - TaskCancelConfirm (Canceled/CancelFailed/CancelNotFound) 
   - TaskResult (if task completed before cancel took effect)

3. **TaskResult after cancel**: If TaskResult arrives after cancel was requested, the future is still marked as cancelled (maintains cancel semantics)

## Conclusion
The current implementation already meets all requirements. No code changes needed to `client/future.py`.

The TaskCancelConfirm protocol and new cancel semantics are working as intended.
