# ScalerFuture Implementation Status

## Summary
After thorough investigation, I found that the ScalerFuture implementation in `scaler/client/future.py` is **already correctly handling the new TaskCancelConfirm protocol**. All future-related tests are passing successfully.

## Current Implementation Features

### 1. TaskCancelConfirm Protocol Support ✅
- The `cancel()` method properly sends TaskCancel messages to the scheduler
- Future waits for TaskCancelConfirm messages before marking as cancelled
- Timeout handling (30 seconds) in case confirmation doesn't arrive
- Proper integration with ClientFutureManager for handling responses

### 2. Race Condition Handling ✅
- Lines 71-75 in `set_result_ready()`: If a cancel request is pending and TaskResult arrives, the future is marked as cancelled instead of setting the result
- This maintains the semantic that once `cancel()` is called, the future should be considered cancelled

### 3. Cancellation Flow ✅
```python
def cancel(self) -> bool:
    # 1. Send TaskCancel message to scheduler
    # 2. Create _cancel_ready_event and wait for confirmation
    # 3. Return True if confirmation received or timeout occurs
```

### 4. TaskCancelConfirm Handling ✅
The ClientFutureManager properly handles different confirmation types:
- `Canceled`: Task successfully cancelled, future marked as cancelled
- `CancelNotFound`: Task not found, treated as cancelled
- `CancelFailed`: Cancel failed, future continues waiting for TaskResult

### 5. Test Results ✅
All ScalerFuture tests pass:
- `test_as_completed` ✅
- `test_callback` ✅  
- `test_cancel` ✅
- `test_client_disconnected` ✅
- `test_exception` ✅
- `test_state` ✅

## Implementation Details

### Key Methods
1. **`cancel()`** (lines 179-205): Handles cancel requests with proper waiting
2. **`set_cancel_confirmed()`** (lines 92-103): Called when TaskCancelConfirm received
3. **`set_result_ready()`** (lines 64-90): Handles race conditions between cancel and result

### Backward Compatibility
- `set_canceled()` method maintained for compatibility (line 105-107)

## Conclusion
**No changes are needed** to `scaler/client/future.py`. The implementation already correctly handles:
1. New TaskCancelConfirm protocol
2. Race conditions between cancel and task completion
3. All expected cancellation semantics
4. All unit test cases pass

The current implementation satisfies all requirements specified by the user.
