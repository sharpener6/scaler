"""
This example was copied from https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/examples/highly_parallel.html

Only one or two changes are needed to make this example work on Scaler.
First is to import the compatibility layer, this patches Ray Core's API.
The second is to call `ray.shutdown()`, necessary only if using a local cluster.
