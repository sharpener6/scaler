Worker Managers
===============

Worker Managers are components in Scaler that handle the actual provisioning and destruction of worker resources. They act as the bridge between Scaler's scaling policies and various infrastructure providers (e.g., local processes, cloud instances, container orchestrators).

.. note::
    For more details on how to configure Scaler, see the :doc:`../configuration` section.

.. note::
    By default, the scheduler starts with the ``no`` scaling policy, meaning no workers are provisioned automatically. A worker manager will connect to the scheduler but will not receive any scaling commands until a policy that performs scaling is configured. To enable auto-scaling, pass a ``--policy-content`` (``-pc``) flag to the scheduler.

Enabling Auto-Scaling
---------------------

To enable auto-scaling with a worker manager, configure the scheduler's scaling policy using the ``--policy-content`` (``-pc``) flag. For example, to use the vanilla scaler:

.. code-block:: bash

    scaler_scheduler tcp://127.0.0.1:8516 -pc "allocate=even_load; scaling=vanilla"

Once the scheduler is running with this policy, start a worker manager (e.g., the Native manager):

.. code-block:: bash

    scaler_worker_manager_baremetal_native tcp://127.0.0.1:8516 --max-task-concurrency 8

The vanilla policy will then automatically scale workers up and down based on the task-to-worker ratio. For a full description of available scaling policies and their parameters, see :doc:`../scaling`.

Managers Overview
-----------------

Scaler provides several worker managers to support different execution environments.

Native
~~~~~~

The :doc:`Native <native>` worker manager provisions workers as local subprocesses on the same machine.
It supports both dynamic auto-scaling (default) and fixed-pool mode, where a set number of workers
are pre-spawned at startup.

AWS HPC
~~~~~~~

The :doc:`AWS HPC <aws_hpc/index>` worker manager allows Scaler to offload task execution to cloud environments, currently supporting AWS Batch. It is ideal for bursting workloads to the cloud or utilizing specific hardware not available locally.

Common Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All worker managers share a set of :doc:`common configuration parameters <common_parameters>` for networking, worker behavior, and logging.
