Native Worker Manager
=====================

The Native worker manager allows Scaler to dynamically provision workers as local subprocesses on the same machine where the manager is running. This is the simplest way to scale Scaler workloads across multiple CPU cores on a single machine or a group of machines.

Getting Started
---------------

To start the Native worker manager, use the ``scaler_worker_manager_baremetal_native`` command.

Example command:

.. code-block:: bash

    scaler_worker_manager_baremetal_native tcp://<SCHEDULER_IP>:8516 \
        --max-workers 4 \
        --logging-level INFO \
        --task-timeout-seconds 60

Equivalent configuration using a TOML file:

.. code-block:: bash

    scaler_worker_manager_baremetal_native tcp://<SCHEDULER_IP>:8516 --config config.toml

.. code-block:: toml

    # config.toml

    [native_worker_manager]
    max_workers = 4
    logging_level = "INFO"
    task_timeout_seconds = 60

*   ``tcp://<SCHEDULER_IP>:8516`` is the address workers will use to connect to the scheduler.
*   The manager can spawn up to 4 worker subprocesses.

How it Works
------------

When the scheduler determines that more capacity is needed, it sends a request to the Native worker manager. The manager then spawns a new worker process using the same Python interpreter and environment that started the manager.

Each worker group managed by the Native manager contains exactly one worker process.

Unlike the Fixed Native worker manager, which spawns a static number of workers at startup, the Native worker manager is designed to be used with Scaler's auto-scaling features to dynamically grow and shrink the local worker pool based on demand.

Supported Parameters
--------------------

.. note::
    For more details on how to configure Scaler, see the :doc:`../configuration` section.

The Native worker manager supports the following specific configuration parameters in addition to the common worker manager parameters.

Native Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*   ``--max-workers`` (``-mw``): Maximum number of worker subprocesses that can be started. Set to ``-1`` for no limit (default: ``-1``).
*   ``--preload``: Python module or script to preload in each worker process before it starts accepting tasks.
*   ``--worker-io-threads`` (``-wit``): Number of IO threads for the IO backend per worker (default: ``1``).

Common Parameters
