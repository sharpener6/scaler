    Creates a TUNTAP interface and sets brings it up and adds ips using the `ip` program

    Args:
        iface_name: The name of the TUNTAP interface, usually like `tun0`, `tun1`, etc.
        mitm_ip: The desired ip address of the mitm. This is the ip that clients can use to connect to the mitm
        remote_ip: The ip that routes to/from the tuntap interface.
        packets sent to `mitm_ip` will appear to come from `remote_ip`,\
        and conversely the tuntap interface can connect/send packets
        to `remote_ip`, making it a suitable ip for binding a server
